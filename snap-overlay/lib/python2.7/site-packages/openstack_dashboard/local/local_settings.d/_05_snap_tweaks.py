# Tweaks to make this run nicely in a snap.

# We don't want django to try writing the secret key before we've told
# it not to attempt to write it out in the read only snap dir in our
# local_settings.py. So we override the behavior of the default
# settings.py here.

# Django wants to write out compressed files even when we turn
# compression off (either a bug or something that I'm not
# understanding). Tell it to write them some place writeable.
